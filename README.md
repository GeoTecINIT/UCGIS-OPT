## UCGIS - Occupational Profile Tool (OPT)

#### Introduction

The [Occupational Profile Tool](https://ucgis-opt.web.app) (OPT) allows users to browse, create, edit and share occupational profiles in the field of Earth Observation and Geographic Information. Occupational profiles can be characterized as generic, recurring prototypical job descriptions, including the required knowledge and skills to be able to perform them. They can be used as a basis for creating recurrent job offers made available by any kind of organisation. Profiles are linked to the UCGIS Body of Knowledge (BoK) for EO/GI-specific concepts and skills, to the [European Skills/Competences and Occupation (ESCO)](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/skill) classification for transversal and cross-sectoral skills and to UNESCO’s [International Standard Classification of Education: Fields of Education and Training (ISCED-F)](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/escopedia/International_Standard_Classification_of_Education_58__Fields_of_Education_and_Training_2013__40_ISCED-F_41_) classification for the application field. 

#### Authors
The UCGIS BoK tools are developed by the [Geospatial Technologies Research Group](http://geotec.uji.es/) (GEOTEC) from the University Jaume I, Castellón (Spain) and are Licenced under GNU GPLv3.
